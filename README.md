# anime_vault
 This is simple NextJS landing page demonstrating  Server Actions and  infinite scrolling and Framer Motion animations with Next 14.
 The data for the anime card is dynamic and the concept of async & await is used to fetch the data from a free anime API
 The layout is fully responsive and has subtle animations for redendering cards using Framer Motion
 For triggering of infinite-scroll effect a package called react-intersection-observer is being used
